Authentication Done and Google Drive is ready to use. Next step is uploading the Files on the drive.

File IDs: Every file has a unique Opaque ID and they are accessed by those IDs only.

The file is located with the help of a search operation and this decides the file name and its parent folder.

Metadata

Each file contains metadata describing the content. This includes the file name, type, creation and modification times.

Some metadata fields like the file name are user-agnostic and appear the same for each user. Others, such as capabilities and viewedByMeDate contain per-user values.
